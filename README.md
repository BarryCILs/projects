# AI/ML/Data Projects

## Time Series Forecasting Project Aug 2022 – Oct 2022
Group project
(Subject scored 88/100)

• Forecasted Hongkong tourism arrival numbers based on time series data using the autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA) model.

• Applied the Season-Trend decomposition (STL) method to identify seasonality patterns and trend patterns
from the time series data.

• Researched and implemented advanced ML methods like LightGBM and Prophet, to further reduce the
RMSE forecasting error by 43%.

## Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) Research Project Aug 2022 – Oct 2022
Individual project
(Subject scored 95/100)

• Researched CycleGAN and built the model using the TensorFlow package to conduct image translation on
unpaired samples.

• Collected new sets of image samples for model training, the model was then capable of translating unpair
images with Per-Class Accuracy of 77.10% and 78.40% respectively.

## Smart Recycling Deep Learning Project Apr 2022 – May 2022
Individual project
(Subject scored 88/100)

• Created an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), then improved the model
using MobileNet v3 Large (MN3L) model from TensorFlow packages based on transfer learning.

• Applied image augmentation to generate more synthetic training images to generalise the model to improve
performance on unseen images.

• Built a Recyclable rubbish classifier Web App prototype using the best-performing model with 96% accuracy
for image classification.

## Customer Relationship Marketing Machine Learning Project Sep 2021 – Oct 2021
Individual project
(Subject scored 89/100)

• Prepared data pre-processing, data transformation and feature engineering to filter out important customer
details for customer response prediction on product purchase records.

• Built and trained 6 different Machine learning models such as KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest,
AdaBoost and Stacking for customer response prediction using Scikit-Learn packages, models overall
performance achieved over 90% accuracy.
